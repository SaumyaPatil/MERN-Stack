// What?
// React is a JS library which is used to create UI components effectively.


// Watch DOM video also - Babbar

// Why?
// Using function the components are created which is reusable. Component based architecture -> reusable code / modular code -> easy to understand and debug
// Virtual DOM - HTML jab haam likhte hai tab DOM create hota hai, heirarchy banti hai. So, in react a light weight copy of actual DOM is also created.
// So whenever you perform any operation, react uses its intelligence on how it can with minimal effort update / edit or refresh only required components to optimise performance. It performs kind of DOM manipulation. 
// reusable, easy to understand, easy to debug, cleaner code.
// Creates SPAs with dynamic reload / updation.
// You can maintain state also in react. Using props you can transfer data between components. 
// React has various hooks. There r certain features of react which are needed and those are used with the help of hooks.

// Faster development process
// Optimised performance in comparison to traditional way of building UI using HTML, CSS, JS
// Library is such a piece of code that is focused on specific functionality. 
// That caters multiple things come under frameworks.
// React is used to create SPAs
// Updation in SPAs is done dynamically component wise. Doesnt reload page after initial rendering.


// React was built by FB through Jordan in 2011. Open sourced in 2013.
